In which $ME$ stands for mechanical energy, $T$ stands for kinetic energy, $V$ stands for potential energy



The theoretical mechanic energy is $-156.8000000000001$ J 

The average calculated mechanical energy is $-119.77303117971792$ J

The Root Mean Square Error of mechanical energy is $47.84341654613454$

the standard deviation of mechanical energy is  $0.10058045206497976$

Therefore the calculated energy stays close to the theoretical energy, meaning the energy of this system converges to the theoretical value. Facing this complex situation, the error seems to add up. This simulation has a fair accuracy and a high preciseness.
