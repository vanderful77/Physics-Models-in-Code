In which $ME$ stands for mechanical energy, $T$ stands for kinetic energy, $V$ stands for potential energy





The theoretical mechanic energy is $-5.684341886080802e-14$ J 

The average calculated mechanical energy is $9.791957446798166$ J

The Root Mean Square Error of mechanical energy is $10.442064977519793$

the standard deviation of mechanical energy is  $0.20280400195767787$



Therefore the calculated energy stays close to the theoretical energy, meaning the energy of this system converges to the theoretical value. The simulation has a high accuracy and a high preciseness.
