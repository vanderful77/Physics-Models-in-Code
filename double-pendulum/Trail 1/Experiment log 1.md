In which $ME$ stands for mechanical energy, $T$ stands for kinetic energy, $V $stands for potential energy



The theoretical mechanic energy is $-235.20000000000005$ J 

The average calculated mechanical energy is $-235.02156001076722$ J

The Root Mean Square Error of mechanical energy is $1.0002247864495433$

the standard deviation of mechanical energy is  $0.0025309203425212742$

Therefore the calculated energy stays close to the theoretical energy, meaning the energy of this system converges to the theoretical value. The simulation has a high accuracy and a high preciseness.
