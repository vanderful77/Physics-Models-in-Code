In which $ME$ stands for mechanical energy, $T_{rad}$ stands for radical kinetic energy, $T_{tan}$ stands for tangential kinetic energy, $V_{elas}$ stands for elastic potential energy, $V_{grav}$ stands for gravitational potential energy. 

The theoretical mechanic energy is $4.557556103738345$ J 

The average calculated mechanical energy is $4.276182907948614$ J

The Root Mean Square Error of mechanical energy is $0.3070907542622156$

the standard deviation of mechanical energy is  $0.014888906668574658$

Therefore the calculated energy stays close to the theoretical energy, meaning the energy of this system converges to the theoretical value.  This simulation has a high accuracy and a high preciseness.
