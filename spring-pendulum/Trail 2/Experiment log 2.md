In which $ME$ stands for mechanical energy, $T_{rad}$ stands for radical kinetic energy, $T_{tan}$ stands for tangential kinetic energy, $V_{elas}$ stands for elastic potential energy, $V_{grav}$ stands for gravitational potential energy. 



The theoretical mechanic energy is $-2.200000000000001$ J 

The average calculated mechanical energy is $-2.0769138619149143$ J

The Root Mean Square Error of mechanical energy is $0.1424396880941304$

the standard deviation of mechanical energy is  $0.017137885306576336$

Therefore the calculated energy stays close to the theoretical energy, meaning the energy of this system converges to the theoretical value.  This simulation has a high accuracy and a high preciseness.
