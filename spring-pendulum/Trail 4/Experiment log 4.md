In which $ME$ stands for mechanical energy, $T_{rad}$ stands for radical kinetic energy, $T_{tan}$ stands for tangential kinetic energy, $V_{elas}$ stands for elastic potential energy, $V_{grav}$ stands for gravitational potential energy. 



The theoretical mechanic energy is $-4.353955117009324$ J 

The average calculated mechanical energy is $-4.300729771926146$ J

The Root Mean Square Error of mechanical energy is $0.06163391174116638$

the standard deviation of mechanical energy is  $0.003870907691326819$

Therefore the calculated energy is close enough to the theoretical energy, meaning the energy of this system conserves and the simulation has a high accuracy.
